# E-Commerce Project (JavaScript) - Legacy Version

> ⚠️ **This is an archived/legacy version** - This project has been migrated to TypeScript.  
> **Current version:** [../ecommerce-project/](../../ecommerce-project/) (TypeScript)

This is the original JavaScript version of the e-commerce project, kept for reference and comparison purposes. It demonstrates the same functionality as the TypeScript version but uses plain JavaScript (.jsx) instead of TypeScript (.tsx).

## Why Keep This Version?

- 📚 **Learning Reference** - Compare JavaScript vs TypeScript implementations
- 🔄 **Migration Example** - See what changed during TypeScript migration
- 📖 **Historical Context** - Original codebase before modernization

## Quick Info

**Tech Stack:**
- React 19 (JavaScript)
- Vite 6
- React Router 7
- Axios, Day.js
- Vitest for testing

**Key Difference from Current Version:**
- `.jsx` files instead of `.tsx`
- No TypeScript type annotations
- Otherwise identical functionality

## Running This Legacy Version

```powershell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test
```

**Note:** You'll need the [ecommerce-backend](../../ecommerce-backend/) running on port 3000.

## Migration to TypeScript

This project was migrated to TypeScript to provide:
- Better type safety and IDE support
- Catch errors at compile time
- Improved developer experience
- Industry-standard best practices

**See the current version:** [../../ecommerce-project/](../../ecommerce-project/)

## For Active Development

**Use the TypeScript version** at `../../ecommerce-project/` for:
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Learning modern React practices

This JavaScript version is **read-only** and maintained only for reference.
